# Assembly 6D pose estimation dataset demo

This repository provides code that demonstrates how to use the dataset TODO. The dataset contains RGB-D images with ground truth annotations.

The dataset is collected for the purpose of the project published in TODO. For more details about the dataset details prease refere to the publication

The main purpose of this code is to demonstrate how to use the dataset. The dataset is separated into 4 tasks. Each task contains two syntetically generated training datasets and test dataset with real images.
For each task we provide polygonal meshes for example object, manipulation object and template mesh.
For each dataset sample we provide ground truth pose for manipulation object. Training dataset contains segmentation maps as well.
For more details about dataset, specifically how the dataset is gnerated and which test objects are used in final evaluation please refer to the paper
